# 👋 Hey there, I'm Asneem

I’m a Computer Science student at **VIT-AP University**, and honestly, I just love learning how things work  whether it’s how neurons fire in a neural network or how history shaped the world we live in. I’m one of those people who enjoys looking at both the past and the future: I can spend hours watching old classic movies one day and then dive deep into quantum computing the next.  

My main interests revolve around **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Quantum Computing**, and **Neuromorphic Computing**. I’m especially fascinated by how human-like intelligence can be recreated with circuits, code, and a little bit of curiosity. I love building projects that feel meaningful something that brings creativity and tech together.  

When I’m not coding or debugging (which, let’s be real, is most of the time 😅), you’ll probably find me reading about historical inventions, watching timeless films, or experimenting with a new idea just to see where it leads. I believe in taking small, consistent steps  because even small steps can create big impact over time.  

If you’re someone who likes blending imagination with logic, or if you just enjoy talking about the old and the new — we’ll probably get along great. You can check out my work below or reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat!
